# stampchain.io — Complete Reference for LLMs

> The official Bitcoin Stamps block explorer, API, and minting platform.

## Overview

stampchain.io is the primary block explorer and API for the Bitcoin Stamps protocol. Bitcoin Stamps embed data directly into the Bitcoin UTXO set using bare multisig transactions, creating truly permanent on-chain artifacts that cannot be pruned from Bitcoin full nodes. This makes Bitcoin Stamps fundamentally different from ordinals (which use witness data that can be pruned).

The tagline is: "Unprunable UTXO Art, Because Sats Don't Exist."

## Bitcoin Stamps Protocol

### How It Works
Bitcoin Stamps encode data (images, text, tokens) into Bitcoin transactions using bare multisig outputs. Each output stores a small chunk of data in the public keys of the multisig. Because these outputs remain in the UTXO set (they are unspent), full nodes must retain them indefinitely — making the data permanent.

### Protocol Standards

**SRC-20 (Fungible Tokens)**
- Deploy, mint, and transfer fungible tokens on Bitcoin
- Account-based balance model (not UTXO-based)
- Balances tracked per address by the indexer
- Operations: deploy (create token), mint (claim supply), transfer (send to address)

**SRC-721 (Non-Fungible Tokens)**
- Unique digital artifacts stored permanently on Bitcoin
- Each stamp has a unique stamp number
- Image data embedded directly in transactions
- Supports multiple formats: PNG, GIF, SVG, HTML, WEBP

**SRC-101 (Bitcoin Name Service)**
- Human-readable names on Bitcoin (like ENS for Ethereum)
- Register and manage .btc names
- Transfer and resolve name ownership

## Block Explorer Features

### Stamp Gallery (https://stampchain.io/stamp)
Browse all Bitcoin Stamps with filtering by type, date, and creator. Each stamp page shows:
- Stamp image/content (rendered from on-chain data)
- Transaction details (tx_hash, block height, timestamp)
- Creator address and ownership history
- Stamp metadata (MIME type, file size, encoding)

### SRC-20 Token Explorer (https://stampchain.io/src20)
Browse all SRC-20 tokens with:
- Token details: tick, max supply, minted supply, holders count
- Holder distribution and top holders
- Mint progress and deployment info
- Transfer history

### Collection Browser (https://stampchain.io/collection)
Curated collections of related stamps with:
- Collection metadata and description
- Gallery view of included stamps
- Creator information

### Block Explorer (https://stampchain.io/explorer)
Bitcoin block data showing:
- Blocks with stamp transactions
- Stamp count per block
- Block details with included stamps

### Wallet View (https://stampchain.io/wallet/:address)
Per-address view showing:
- Owned stamps
- SRC-20 token balances
- Transaction history

## Minting Tools

### Stamp Creation (https://stampchain.io/tool/stamp/create)
Create new Bitcoin Stamps on-chain using the OLGA minting engine:
- Upload image/content
- Select encoding method
- Build and sign transaction
- Broadcast to Bitcoin network

- Deploy new tokens: https://stampchain.io/tool/src20/deploy
- Mint tokens: https://stampchain.io/tool/src20/mint
- Transfer tokens: https://stampchain.io/tool/src20/transfer

### SRC-101 Tools
- Register names: https://stampchain.io/tool/src101/register

### Supported Wallets
