# stampchain.io

> The official Bitcoin Stamps block explorer, API, and minting platform.

stampchain.io is the primary block explorer and API for the Bitcoin Stamps protocol — a method of storing data permanently in the Bitcoin UTXO set using bare multisig transactions. Unlike ordinals, Bitcoin Stamps data cannot be pruned from full nodes, making it truly permanent on-chain art and data.

## Key Facts

- Protocol: Bitcoin Stamps (SRC-20, SRC-721, SRC-101)
- Data storage: Embedded in Bitcoin UTXO set via bare multisig
- Permanence: Unprunable — data persists as long as Bitcoin exists
- Explorer: Browse all stamps, SRC-20 tokens, collections, and blocks
- API: RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Minting: On-chain stamp creation tools (OLGA minting engine)
- URL: https://stampchain.io

## Protocol Standards

- SRC-20: Fungible token standard on Bitcoin Stamps (deploy, mint, transfer)
- SRC-721: NFT standard for unique digital artifacts on Bitcoin
- SRC-101: Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) for human-readable addresses
